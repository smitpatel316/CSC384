1. Weighted A* search is kind of like uniform cost search and in the worst case when you have an algorithm that runs exponentially, the issue exists when the search space is huge, causes many successors (branching factor of number of vehicles in the game) since we can move all cars in the worst case scenario. Also since we are using heur min moves and it underestimates the real cost (admissible), it will force A* to expand more and make it slower hence increasing time will make little to no effect.

2. Consider where you have 3 cars blocked to goal (4 moves required to goal) and on the other way you have 5 moves with clear path (no obstruction), min moves will select path with 3 blocked cars which is going to take longer. Min moves heuristic is admissible since it will give you the least number of moves not taking into account of obstructing vehicles, hence it will be lower or equal to shortest path.

3. The key improvement in my alternative heuristic is that it takes into account of vehicles blocking the goal vehicle, providing a better heuristic than min moves. My alternate heuristic is also admissible as it will take into account the moves needed for obstructed vehicles to move and goal vehicle, hence also being lower or equal to shortest path.
